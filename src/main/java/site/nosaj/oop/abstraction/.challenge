For this I don't have a challenge but I'll write my own one.
smth simple:
-ill write an animal abstract class with makeSound() method abstract so every type of animal could declare his own makeSound().

- by doing this i can use the method in the Animal class without having to declare it yet
- if i got it correctly, this is the purpose of the abstraction

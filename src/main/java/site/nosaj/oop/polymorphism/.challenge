Let's practice leveraging polymorphism in Java to reduce application
complexity.
Let's say you want to add a series of contacts to your phone.
For some contacts, you have a name, phone number and email.
For others, you just have a name and phone number.
There are also a few where you only have a name and an email address.
In this challenge, you'll create a program that allows you to create
contact instances in a variety of ways.
After creating a contact instance, you should print it out to the
console.
In the printout, display the information about the contact.
Good luck and have fun.

Let's practice using encapsulation. In this challenge, you'll put your encapsulation
skills to the test by modifying a Java program to use this object oriented principle.
We'll start off with a bank account class. It has two attributes, owner and balance.
Your job is to add behavior to this program so that the owner and balance attributes
can be encapsulated in the bank account class while still being accessible to other
classes indirectly. Specifically you should add a withdrawal method as well as the
deposit method. You might also add a few getters to retrieve the balance or the owner
of the account. In order to create a new bank account instance, you'll also need to
add a constructor to the class. Once you've set up your bank account class, create a
main class that creates a bank account. Withdraw a certain amount from the bank account
and then print out the resulting balance to the console. The attributes of the bank
account class should not be directly accessible. Good luck and have fun.
